## Test Tasks

- task: "Recent Searches (automatic localStorage)"
  implemented: true
  working: "NA"
  file: "/app/apps/frontend/lib/recentSearchStore.ts, /app/apps/frontend/components/features/RecentSearches.tsx"
  stuck_count: 0
  priority: "high"
  needs_retesting: false
  status_history:
    - working: "pending"
      agent: "main"
      comment: "Implemented automatic recent search storage in localStorage. Features: 1) Auto-saves after successful search, 2) FIFO - keeps last 8 searches, 3) Deduplicates identical searches, 4) 7-day expiry, 5) Shows last known price. Homepage component displays recent searches with Framer Motion animations."
    - working: "NA"
      agent: "testing"
      comment: "Frontend localStorage functionality cannot be tested via backend API testing. This requires UI testing which is outside the scope of backend testing. The implementation appears complete based on code review."

- task: "Saved Searches (explicit backend)"
  implemented: true
  working: true
  file: "/app/apps/backend/app/routers/saved_searches.py, /app/apps/frontend/components/features/SaveSearchButton.tsx"
  stuck_count: 0
  priority: "high"
  needs_retesting: false
  status_history:
    - working: "pending"
      agent: "main"
      comment: "Implemented explicit save search with email modal. Features: 1) POST /api/saved-searches stores in MongoDB, 2) Email modal asks for notification consent, 3) Stores last known price for future alerts, 4) Prevents duplicates - updates existing. UI shows 'Saved' state with success message."
    - working: true
      agent: "testing"
      comment: "✅ ALL BACKEND TESTS PASSED (7/7): 1) POST /api/saved-searches successfully saves searches with proper MongoDB schema (id, email, search params, last_known_price, is_active=true, notification_count=0, last_notified_at=null), 2) GET /api/saved-searches correctly retrieves searches by email, 3) Duplicate prevention working - same search updates existing record instead of creating duplicate, 4) DELETE /api/saved-searches/{id} performs soft delete (sets is_active=false), 5) Validation working - invalid email returns 422, missing required fields return 422, 6) Non-existent search deletion returns 404. MongoDB integration fully functional."

## Test Plan
```yaml
current_focus:
  - "Test recent searches localStorage functionality"
  - "Test saved searches backend integration"
  - "Verify email modal and consent flow"
  - "Test search deduplication and expiry"
stuck_tasks: []
test_all: false
test_priority: "high_first"
```

## Agent Communication
- agent: "main"
  message: "Implemented recent searches and saved searches features. Recent searches use localStorage with automatic saving, FIFO management, and 7-day expiry. Saved searches use backend MongoDB storage with email consent modal. Both features include last known price tracking for future price alerts."
- agent: "testing"
  message: "✅ BACKEND TESTING COMPLETE: Saved Searches backend functionality fully tested and working. All 7 API tests passed including save/get/update/delete operations, MongoDB schema validation, duplicate prevention, and error handling. Recent Searches (localStorage) cannot be tested via backend API - requires UI testing. Backend implementation is production-ready."
